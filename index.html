            Thank you for visiting my profile. I'm a full stack developer with experience in: 
            <br>
            Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery  
            <br> 
            Backend: Node.js, Node Handlebars, mySQL, Sequelize, and React.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started taking a coding class at the Uniserity of Charlotte North Carolina, hosted by Trilogy. I became 
            interested in becoming a developer when I was looking for a new career, and tried out Python for a short 
            while on my own. While I was understanding a basic idea of how programming was working, I wanted to find a 
            more structured way of learning than just trying to be self-taught. Throughout that time I have learned how 
            to create pages and backend code that help run those pages.
            <br>
            <br>
            Currently I reside in Charlotte, NC. I'm originally from Maryland, but also lived in Arizona for a few years.
            At the time of living in Arizona I obtained my Bachelor's in English with a focus in literature. My current
            profession is customer service for a major telecommunications company. In December of 2015 I obtained my 
            Master's in Business Administration with a focus of Human Resources. However, my interests started to turn more
            towards IT shortly before being done my Master's program. At first it was for networking, but eventually moved
            on towards programming instead, which led me towards learning web development. My current hobbies outside of 
            work and class includes hiking, karaoke, playing some video games, and at times trampoline dodgeball. 
            <br>
            <br>
            On this page you will find a link to show projects I have worked on that have helped me learn the content needed
            towards being a full stack developer. You can use this site to also reach out to me as well via email. Thank you 
            for taking the time to read my bio and check this page.
